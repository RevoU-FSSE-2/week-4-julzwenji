Please check my site at juliuswenji65.site.
- The site above is same as the previous week, but it was modified by linking to Niaga Hoster and the domain has been updated referring to the rule.
- How I deploy the site:
  1. I bought a domain at Niaga Hoster.
  2. I set the domain in Netlify syncing to what I have bought in Niaga Hoster.
  3. I sign up to Cloudfare for DNS & Cname, then configure them in Niaga Hoster Domain Setting.
  4. I save everything.
